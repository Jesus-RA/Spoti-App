# Spoti-App

I developed this project following an [Angular Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-2-fernando-herrera/ "Fernando Herrera Angular course") provided by Fernando Herrera.

In this project I had the opportunity to put in practice what I learned and improve the project proposed due to this I faced up with problems that helped me to learn and understand better another things.
